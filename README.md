# Emergency-Vehicle-Identification
This project focuses on developing a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model to classify vehicles as either emergency or non-emergency based on images from a Kaggle dataset. The model is designed to aid in quick and accurate identification of emergency vehicles, which is critical for traffic management and prioritization. The architecture of the CNN includes layers such as convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers, with activation functions like ReLU and softmax, optimized for accurate classification. Regularization techniques such as dropout and batch normalization are implemented to reduce overfitting and enhance generalization. Hyperparameters, including learning rate, batch size, and the number of epochs, are systematically tuned to improve performance. The project also investigates potential overfitting issues by analyzing training and validation curves and visualizing model performance metrics. This comprehensive approach ensures a robust and efficient model capable of effectively classifying emergency vehicles from image data.
